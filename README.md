# React Native boilerplate

This project is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate that can be used to kickstart a mobile application. 

## Requirements üíæ

- Node 14 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 10 or up, and will target iOS 11 and up.

- You also need to install the dependencies required by React Native.  
    - [for Android development](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies-3)
    - [for iOS development](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies)
- Go to the [React Native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), then select `React Native CLI Quickstart` tab.  
Follow instructions for your given `development OS` and `target OS`.

## Quick start üíø

To create a new project using the boilerplate simply run :

```
git clone git@github.com:GoldenOwlAsia/mobile-react-native-template.git
```

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can run the project by running:

- `yarn start` to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal
- `yarn <platform>` to run the *platform* application (remember to start a simulator or connect a device)

## Configuration üóÉÔ∏è

### Change the appicon
To help generate appicons, you can use an online tool like appicon or easyappicon to generate for both iOS and Android all icons and image sets.

### 1. iOS üçé
To change the appicon of the iOS application, you need to replace all the content of
```
src > ios > *name_of_your_app* > Images.xcassets > AppIcon.appiconset
```
with your appicons generated with appicon for example.

### 2. Android ü§ñ
To change the appicon of the Android application, you need to replace all the content of
```
src > android > app > src > res
```
with your appicons generated with appicon for example.

### Change the splash screen icon
### 1. iOS üçé
You can use the same tool (appicon) to generate image sets (@1x, @2x, @3x). Then you just have to replace : Splash_icon@1x.png, Splash_icon@2x.png, Splash_icon@3x.png with yours in :
```
src > ios > *name_of_your_app* > Images.xcassets > SplashIcon.imageset
```
### 2. Android ü§ñ
You just have to replace the splash_icon.png located at :
```
src > android > app > src > res > drawable
```

## Content üß≥
The boilerplate contains a clear directory layout to provide a base architecture for your application with some essential dependencies:

- `React Native` (v0.71.4) application (in "ejected" mode to allow using dependencies that rely on native code)
- `Redux` (v^8.0.5) to help manage state
- `Redux Toolkit` (Query) (v^1.9.3) to improve redux api calls
- `Redux Persist` (v^6.0.0) to persist the Redux state
- `React Native mmkv` (v^2.6.2) which is an efficient, small mobile key-value storage
- `React Navigation` (v^6.1.6) to handle routing and navigation in the app, with a splash screen setup by default
- `React I18Next` (v^12.2.0) to handle internationalization in your app
- `prettier` and `eslint` preconfigured for React Native
- `react-native-flipper` (v^0.182.0) to debug react-native, `redux-flipper` (v^2.0.2) to debug redux, `navigation devtool` (v^6.0.18) to debug navigation,

The boilerplate includes an example (displaying fake user data) from UI components to the business logic. The example is easy to remove so that it doesn't get in the way.

## Directory layout üóÇÔ∏è
- `src/components`: presentational components
- `src/hooks`: hooks of the app, you will have the useTheme hook to access the theme
- `src/navigators`: react navigation navigators
- `src/screens`: container components, i.e. the application's screens
- `src/services`: application services, e.g. API clients
- `src/stores`: redux actions, reducers and stores
- `src/theme`: base styles for the application
- `src/translations`: application strings, you can add languages files and be able to translate your app strings
